# Gold Price Prediction with LSTM and BiLSTM

This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict gold prices using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural networks. The project utilizes historical gold price data sourced from Yahoo Finance, spanning from 2019 to 2023. The results of this project are the performance values of the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models using R-squared, RMSE, and MAPE
